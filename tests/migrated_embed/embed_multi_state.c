/*
 * embed_multi_state.c -- 16 states x 16 pthreads stress test.
 *
 * Guarantees under test (Phase 4 "one mino_state_t per thread" story):
 *   - A mino_state_t is wholly self-contained: no cross-state globals,
 *     no shared intern tables, no shared schedulers, no shared GC. An
 *     embedder may create one per thread and run them in parallel
 *     without locks, as long as no single state is touched by more
 *     than one thread concurrently.
 *   - GC cycles, remembered-set bookkeeping, and allocator accounting
 *     stay consistent under sustained allocation pressure driven from
 *     16 concurrent threads.
 *
 * Shape: each worker thread owns one mino_state_t + env, evaluates a
 * workload that forces minor + major collections, reads back results
 * via a known-value check, and exits with a per-thread failure count.
 * The main thread sums the counts; exit 0 means every worker saw what
 * it expected.
 *
 * Build (from repo root):
 *   cc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -Isrc -pthread -o embed_multi_state tests/embed_multi_state.c src/<dot>c -lm
 * where <dot>c is shell glob for all C sources.
