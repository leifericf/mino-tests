;; Reader robustness: feed adversarial inputs through read-string and verify
;; the reader handles them gracefully (throws or returns a value, never crashes).
;; If any input causes a segfault, the test runner process dies and CI fails.

;; Helper: assert that read-string doesn't crash. It may return a value or
;; throw — both are fine. A crash (segfault) is the failure mode.
